# 1. Overview
This README has three primary functions:
    1. To articulate the desired behavior for clarity in understanding.
    2. To log entries of my process to track my thinking, attempts, success/failures, etc.
       to keep from running in circles.
    3. Notes on example inputs and outputs.

# 2. Behavior
The purpose of this assignment it to expand upon HW02/calc.py to implement a one-dimensional `List`.

    ## 2.1: Lists
    - A grouping of evaluated expressions inside parenthesis, separated by commas,
    with the output having a trailing comma. Each value is to be manipulated in expressions as well.
        Example 1: (1, 1+1, x+1) prints as (1, 2, 3,) with x = 2.
        Example 2: -(1, 2, 3) prints (-1, -2, -3,)
        Example 3: (1, 2, 3) * 2 prints (1, 4, 6,)
    - Lists should also be able to be manipulated by other lists.
        Example: listA =  (1, 2, 3), listB = (2, 4, 6)
            listA + listB outputs (3, 6, 9,)

# 3. Development
This section is a pseudo-journal entry of my process in figuring out the task.

    ## 3.1 Anticipation of Process
    1. Define the RegEx pattern for a List.
    2. Write rules for the different situations a List will be in to match the expected behavior

    ## 3.2 Defining a List
